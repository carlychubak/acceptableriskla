<h1><i>High Beams 3: Laser Snakes</i></h1>
<h3>April 17, 2021</h3>

 "Playfully titled Laser Snake, the COVID-safe exhibition will prove to be the most exuberant and mystical yet, with 
 live performances from art clowns, wheat threshing, painters erasing musicians from view, and at least three pyramids, 
 each with a different meaning and aesthetic. The title was inspired by the first High Beams show, when a queue of 150 
 cars formed a “laser snake” as it meandered through a rooftop parking lot." --<a href="https://www.highbeams.art/">High Beams</a>
