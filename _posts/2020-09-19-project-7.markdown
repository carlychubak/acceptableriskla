<h1><i>Other Places art fair (OPaf)</i></h1>
<h3>September 19 - October 31, 2020</h3>

 "Fluid in definition, bonded by an intention to operate in other places outside the traditional 
 art gallery systems, OPaf (Other Places art fair) features participants presenting site-specific 
 booths encapsulating their projects and programming. Representing the growing movement of 
 hard-to-define art spaces, OPaf provides an alternative art fair structure designed specifically for 
 these unconventional projects." --<a href="https://www.opaf.info/">OPaf</a>
